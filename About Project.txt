This project focuses on predicting the prices of used bikes using Linear Regression. By analyzing various input features such as the bike's age, mileage, brand, and condition, the model forecasts the most accurate price. The prediction model is trained on a comprehensive dataset of used bikes, ensuring robust and reliable predictions. Users can input specific details about the bike they are interested in, and the model will process this information to provide an estimated market value. With an easy-to-use interface, this project brings the power of data science to the fingertips of anyone looking to buy or sell a used bike, enhancing transparency and efficiency in the marketplace. The various tools used in this project are Python, Flask, Sklearn, HTML and CSS.
